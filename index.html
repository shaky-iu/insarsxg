## 🛰️ **Welcome to XuGuo SHI Research Group**

We are the **Synthetic Aperture Radar and Geohazard Monitoring Research Group** at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). Our research focuses on:

- **SAR Signal Processing**: Developing advanced algorithms for SAR data interpretation
- **Geohazard Monitoring**: Using InSAR for landslide, subsidence, and earthquake monitoring
- **Engineering Applications**: SAR for infrastructure health monitoring
- **Environmental Studies**: Glacier movement, coastal changes, and land use monitoring

### 🔬 **Research Highlights**
1. **Urban Subsidence Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of ground deformation in major cities
2. **Landslide Early Warning**: Developing early warning systems using time-series InSAR
3. **Infrastructure Safety**: Bridge and dam deformation monitoring using PS-InSAR
