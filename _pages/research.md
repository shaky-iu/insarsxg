      Our group mainly studies the problems associated with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and explores the Earth, or even other planets, with it. SAR is one of the most important instruments for Earth observation. We are entering the golden age of SAR remote sensing. Unlike most optical instruments, SAR is an active sensor that transmits pulses toward the Earth and then receives the back-scattered echoes. Therefore, SAR does not require the illumination from the Sun and can image in daylight or at night. SAR operates at microwave bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. The microwave signals can go through clouds, which enables SAR to work in all-weather conditions.

          The original data acquired by SAR is called raw data, which is much like pure noise if you view it with an image application. Through signal processing techniques, or focusing, an image can be formed. Further processing, e.g. denoising, is thus performed in the image domain for numerous purposes. Previously one of our group's focuses is on the processing of data acquired in advanced modes such as spotlight, ScanSAR, TOPS and SweepSAR, which requires more sophisticated signal processing algorithms (e.g. <a href="#" style="color: #009688;">Liang et al., 2017, IEEE TGRS</a>).

          A SAR image is a complex image with both magnitude and phase. By comparing the phases of two radar images, InSAR can measure topography or deformation on the Earth's surface. The cool thing about satellite InSAR is that it can cover large areas (hundreds of kilometers) with high spatial resolution (meters), making it ideal for monitoring earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides.
